Week 6 Homework

This one's a bit of a throwback to the TV shows that I grew up watching as a kid. Using jQuery's ajax method, we call upon data from the GIPHY API and get it to display on the page.

At initial load, there will be a button for ten different TV shows from the 80's & 90's. Clicking on any of the buttons will pull up 10 GIFs related to that show. To get the GIF to play, just simply click on the image. Clicking on the image again will get it to stop playing.

Clicking on any other new button will clear the GIFs from the previously-selected TV show and bring up 10 new GIFs.

If there are any shows from your childhood that you want to add, simply type the show's name into the text box provided and click on Submit. A new button will be created. Click and reminisce!
